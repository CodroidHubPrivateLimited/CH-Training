Problem 2: Online Education Platform – Landing Page







 1. Objective
Build a responsive homepage for an online education/e-learning platform using HTML + CSS (no frameworks unless specified).
 The focus is on layout, responsiveness, and user experience.

 2. Mandatory Sections
Header
Must include:


Logo (text or image).


Navigation Menu: Courses | About Us | Contact | Login.


Hero Section
Eye-catching headline (e.g., “Learn Anytime, Anywhere”).


Illustration / education-related image.


CTA Button (e.g., “Start Learning” or “Browse Courses”).


Courses Section
At least 3 course cards.


Each course card must have:


Title (e.g., “Web Development”).


Short description.


Enroll Button.


Why Choose Us Section
At least 3 points with icons (e.g., 🎓 Expert Teachers, 🌐 Flexible Learning, 📜 Certifications).


Footer
Newsletter subscription form (input field + “Subscribe” button).


Social links (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram).



 3. Responsiveness
Mobile-first design.


Breakpoints:


Mobile (≤ 768px).


Tablet (769px – 1024px).


Desktop (1025px+).


On smaller screens:


Navigation collapses/vertical stack.


Cards stack in a single column.



 4. GitHub Submission
Push all code to public GitHub repo.


Repo name format:
 Name_Reevaluation_Html/Css
 Example: Dikshant_Reevaluation_HtmlCss
Include clear documentation (README files)  outlining the objective, tech stack, setup steps, and key features.



 5. Quality Expectations
Semantic HTML (<header>, <section>, <footer>).


CSS should be clean and modular.


Consistent design system (fonts, colors, spacing).


Professional layout (like a real e-learning website).


README (optional but recommended).

🚨 Notice 🚨
No one is allowed to use ChatGPT or any other AI tools/resources during the HTML/CSS and Git/GitHub test.
⚠️ If anyone is found using such tools, he/she will be directly disqualified from the re-evaluation process.
