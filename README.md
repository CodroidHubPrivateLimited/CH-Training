# 📚 CodroidHub Training Repository

Welcome to the **CodroidHub Training Repository**!  
This repository serves as the central hub for all training programs conducted by CodroidHub, hosting structured materials, projects, and progress updates across multiple domains.

## 🌟 Branches by Training Batch

To keep the repository organized, **content is maintained in separate branches for each batch**. For example:  

- `July-September,2025` → Work and submissions for the July–September 2025 batch  
- Future batches will have their own branches (e.g., `October-December,2025`)  

> The **main branch** contains only the repository structure, guidelines, and instructions for contributors.

- Data Analytics

- Figma  
- Finance
