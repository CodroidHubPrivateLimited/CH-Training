Here’s a clean, student-friendly revision of the README, tailored for **January–June 2026** and extended to include **FDP (Faculty Development Program)**. I’ve kept it simple, explicit, and future-proof—like good documentation should be.

# 📚 CodroidHub Training Repository

Welcome to the **CodroidHub Training Repository** 👋
This repository is the central workspace for all **CodroidHub training programs**, where students and faculty can upload assignments, projects, and learning artifacts in an organized and trackable way.

---

## 🌟 Training Batch: January – June 2026

All work for the **January–June 2026 batch** is maintained in its **own branch**.

* **Branch name:** `January-June,2026`

> ⚠️ The **main branch** only contains repository structure, rules, and general instructions.
> **All uploads must be done inside your batch branch.**

---

## 📁 Current Structure (Important)

At present, **this branch contains only one main folder**.
All students and faculty must upload their work **inside this folder only**, following the rules below.

---

## 🚀 Training Domains (For Students)

Inside the batch folder, training is organized by **domain**.
Each domain will contain **individual folders for each student**.

Available domains include:

* Data Analytics
* Data Science
* Figma
* Finance
* Flutter
* Graphic Designing
* LLM
* MERN
* Marketing

### 👩‍🎓 Student Folder Structure

```

## 🎓 FDP (Faculty Development Program)

This repository also supports **FDP uploads**.

### 🏫 FDP Folder Structure

FDP work must follow this strict hierarchy:

```
FDP/
 └── College_Name/
     └── Teacher_Name/
          ├── Assignments/
          ├── Projects/
          └── Certificates/
```

### 📌 FDP Upload Rules

* Each **college gets its own folder**
* Inside it, create folders for **each teacher**
* Inside the teacher folder, create a folder using the **assigned teacher code**
* Upload all FDP-related materials only inside that code folder

This structure helps CodroidHub track:

* College-wise participation
* Teacher-wise progress
* FDP compliance and certification

---

## 🌱 Contribution Guidelines (For Everyone)

* Upload content **only in your assigned folder**
* Use clear commit messages

  * Example: `Added Week 2 MERN assignments`
* Follow naming conventions exactly
* Keep the repository clean and organized
